# BogoSort
BogoSort is an inefficient sorting algorithm that randomly shuffles an array until it is sorted.

### How it works:
1. Check if the array is sorted.
2. If not, shuffle the array randomly.
3. Repeat until the array is sorted.

### Time Complexity:
- **Worst-case**: O((n+1)!) due to the random permutations.
- **Average-case**: O((n+1)!) as it has no systematic approach.

### Practical use:
Rarely used in practice, typically for educational or humorous purposes.
